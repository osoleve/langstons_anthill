## 2025-12-24 - The Ceryneian Hind 🦌

**Sighting:** A massive undertaking, frozen in a wish list.

**Location:** `anthill-core/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Notes:** The Hind found a mountain: "PyO3 bindings via maturin." Too steep to climb in one leap. The Hind has trodden a path up the slope: configuration first, then data conversion, then the engine itself. The hunt is now possible.

## 2025-12-25 - The Moth 🦋

**Sighting:** Two rivers of time that flow parallel but never touch.

**Location:** `anthill-core/src/engine.rs` (lines 80 and 124)

**Notes:** The Moth sees the `tick()` function and the `process_offline_progress()` function.
One breathes life into the world, step by step, emitting the events that make history.
The other dreams the world forward in silence, mimicking the hunger, the aging, the production, but without the soul of events.
They duplicate the logic of life—feeding, dying, working—but the dream is a simplified shadow of the waking world.
They rhyme in purpose, but drift in form.
