## 2025-12-24 - The Ceryneian Hind 🦌

**Sighting:** A massive undertaking, frozen in a wish list.

**Location:** `anthill-core/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Notes:** The Hind found a mountain: "PyO3 bindings via maturin." Too steep to climb in one leap. The Hind has trodden a path up the slope: configuration first, then data conversion, then the engine itself. The hunt is now possible.
