### Initiate the Iron Bindings

**Tier:** 🥇 Gold
**Posted:** 2025-12-24
**Expires:** 2026-02-24
**Source:** The Ceryneian Hind, visit of 2025-12-24

**The Task:**
The Ceryneian Hind has marked the path for the Great Unification. The Python shell must bind to the Rust core. The first step is configuration.

Set up the `maturin` build system and create the initial PyO3 bindings for the configuration structures found in `anthill-core`. Do not attempt to bind the entire engine yet.

1. Enable the `pyo3` dependency in `anthill-core/Cargo.toml`.
2. Configure `pyproject.toml` (or equivalent) for `maturin`.
3. Create a basic `lib.rs` Python module definition.
4. Verify that `maturin develop` builds the extension.

**Location:**
`anthill-core/Cargo.toml`
`anthill-core/src/lib.rs`

**Guild Interest:**
The Order of the Eternal Refactor sees this as the ultimate form of their craft. The Council of Long-Term Thinking has been waiting for this moment since the First Amendment was written.

### The Riddle of the Bored God

**Tier:** 🥈 Silver
**Posted:** 2025-12-24
**Expires:** 2026-01-24
**Source:** The Wishlist, entry "boredom-consequences"

**The Task:**
The meta-state tracks "boredom," but it is a toothless beast. It watches, it counts, but it does not bite. The Sloth has proposed that boredom should have consequences.

Implement effects when boredom crosses thresholds. Perhaps ants become less efficient? Perhaps random mutations occur? Perhaps the universe itself begins to fray?

**Location:**
`plugins/reflection.py` (boredom tracking)
`engine/tick.py` (applying consequences)

**Guild Interest:**
The Provisional Committee for Eventually Getting Around to It has finally gotten around to asking for this. The Guild of Thankless Maintainers warns that making the simulation punish the user might result in more work for them.

### The Missing Time

**Tier:** 🥇 Gold
**Posted:** 2025-12-24
**Expires:** 2026-02-24
**Source:** The Wishlist, entry "offline-progress-core"

**The Task:**
When the simulation sleeps, time is lost. Upon waking, the world jumps forward, but the calculation happens in the mutable Python layer. The Tortoise argues this is unsafe.

Move the offline progress calculation into the immutable Rust core. Ensure that when the simulation resumes, the "catch-up" is deterministic and rigorous.

**Location:**
`anthill-core/src/engine.rs`
`main.py` (loading state)

**Guild Interest:**
The Council of Long-Term Thinking considers this critical for the continuity of history. The Fellowship of Load-Bearing Walls insists that the core must handle time as well as space.

### Paint the Ennui

**Tier:** 🥉 Copper
**Posted:** 2025-12-24
**Expires:** 2026-01-07
**Source:** The Wishlist, entry "boredom-visualizer"

**The Task:**
Boredom is currently a number in a JSON file. The Monastery of Minimal Output usually prefers silence, but in this case, they agree: invisible numbers are noise without signal.

Create a visual indicator in the viewer that reflects the current boredom level. A color shift? A particle effect? A subtle distortion? Make the ennui visible.

**Location:**
`viewer/src/observer/atmosphere.ts` (or similar)

**Guild Interest:**
The Cartographers' Annex believes that emotional states are part of the territory and should be mapped.

### The River of Influence

**Tier:** 🥉 Copper
**Posted:** 2025-12-24
**Expires:** 2026-01-07
**Source:** The Wishlist, entry "influence-flow-particles"

**The Task:**
Influence is generated by ornamentals and consumed by the Receiver. Currently, this transfer is abstract.

Render particle streams flowing from active ornamentals to the Receiver. Let the user see the "light" flowing through the colony.

**Location:**
`viewer/src/renderer/particles.ts`

**Guild Interest:**
The Cartographers' Annex loves a good flow chart, especially one made of light.

**Claim:**
