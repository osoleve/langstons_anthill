## Your Task

Choose ONE of these update types:
1. **Timeline entry**: Add a brief entry to docs/journal.md noting a significant event
2. **Stat update**: Update a number in an existing doc (population, resource milestone)
3. **New observation**: Add a small observation to an appropriate doc
4. **Lore snippet**: Add flavor text about something interesting in the current state

Guidelines:
- Make ONE small change, not a rewrite
- Write in the colony's voice (first person plural "we")
- Be factual about what IS, not what should be
- Keep entries brief (1-3 sentences)
- If nothing notable has changed, write "No update needed" and exit

Find the docs/ directory, read the relevant file, and make your small update.
