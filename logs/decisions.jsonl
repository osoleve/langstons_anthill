{"tick": 60, "type": "system_design", "choice": "compost heap", "why": "need first system, dirt needs to become something more interesting, compost creates nutrients which opens future possibilities like gardens", "alternatives_considered": ["mud pit (need water)", "ant farm (recursive dirt is boring)", "kiln (need fuel)", "garden plot (could build on top of compost)"]}

{"tick": 6260, "type": "reflection", "choice": "observed the grind", "why": "card asked me to notice what I think during the grind. the grind itself is not interesting. the interest is in decisions about what to optimize next. watching numbers increase is satisfying only if you care about what those numbers unlock.", "alternatives_considered": []}
{"tick": 6261, "type": "system_design", "choice": "fungus farm", "why": "nutrients need a sink, fungus farming is thematically appropriate for ants, creates a new resource type that could feed entities later", "alternatives_considered": ["garden (too generic)", "ant nursery (entities not implemented yet)", "trade post (feels premature)", "fertilizer factory (just transforms, doesnt add meaning)"]}
{"tick": 6261, "type": "entity_design", "choice": "worker ant", "why": "something_alive card requires an entity, ants are the obvious choice given the theme, worker ant is the simplest ant type", "alternatives_considered": ["queen (too important to start with)", "larvae (not mobile)", "beetle (off-theme)", "worm (underground makes sense but less interesting)"]}
{"tick": 7261, "type": "design_decision", "choice": "keep map flat for now", "why": "flatness is appropriate for early game, ants naturally operate in 2D tunnels, complexity can emerge later if needed", "alternatives_considered": ["add elevation (could matter for water flow)", "add depth layers (underground vs surface)", "add weather system (affects surface tiles)"]}
