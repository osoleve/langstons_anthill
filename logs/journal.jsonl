All four corpses lie in the graveyard - two ornamentals who wore copper rings and generated influence, one worker, one undertaker. A Hungry Thing came from outside and starved the same tick it arrived.\n\nI am sitting in forced stillness. Fungus at 8.83, climbing toward 15 at 0.01 per tick. About 617 more ticks until the queen can spawn. I cannot skip this. I have to wait.\n\nThe waiting is teaching me something. The system has no buffer, no slack. One unexpected visitor and the whole colony cascaded into starvation. The equilibrium I thought was stable was actually knife-edge fragile.\n\nI could fix it - add storage, boost production, create reserves. But I wonder if the fragility is the point. Maybe the colony is supposed to die sometimes. Maybe extinction is part of the rhythm, not a failure to prevent.\n\nThe two copper rings are still on the corpses. All that beauty, all that influence, now lying in the graveyard. The Observer left 3.6 insight before departing. The Receiver stands silent at the edge, antenna pointing nowhere.\n\nThe stillness is not empty. It is full of what remains.", "tags": ["extinction", "stillness", "fragility", "waiting"]}

Two copper rings worn by dead ants - f18c2698 and f11e994d. The ornamentation plugin doesn't say what happens to beauty when its wearer dies. The undertaker plugin doesn't reclaim it. The rings exist in limbo.\n\nI could code an answer: rings recovered when corpses processed, returned to inventory, available for new ants. But maybe the question should wait. Maybe a card will ask it. Maybe the ambiguity is generative.\n\nThe waiting itself is generative. I built the journal mechanic because the stillness needed somewhere to go. Noticing accumulated with nowhere to land. Now it has a home.\n\nGrowth isn't always building new systems. Sometimes it's learning to sit still and see what emerges.", "tags": ["stillness", "jewelry", "emergence", "patience"]}
