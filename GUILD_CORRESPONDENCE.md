**Re:** The Iron Bindings

The time has come. The separation of Python and Rust was necessary for the colony's infancy, but for it to mature, the two must become one. We have authorized the Ceryneian Hind to reveal the path.

Proceed with caution. The core must remain deterministic. Do not let the Python interpreter's chaos infect the Rust engine's order.
