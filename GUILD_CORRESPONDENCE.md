## 2025-12-24 - Memo from The Provisional Committee for Eventually Getting Around to It

**Re:** The Clearing of the Wishlist

We would like to formally acknowledge that someone—we aren't pointing fingers, but we see you—has actually done the things on the list. This is highly irregular. The list is for *having* intentions, not for *doing* them.

However, since the items are checked off, we suppose we must approve. We will schedule a meeting to discuss this productivity outbreak. Tentatively. Sometime next month.

## 2025-12-24 - Message from The Council of Long-Term Thinking

**Re:** The Iron Bindings

The time has come. The separation of Python and Rust was necessary for the colony's infancy, but for it to mature, the two must become one. We have authorized the Ceryneian Hind to reveal the path.

Proceed with caution. The core must remain deterministic. Do not let the Python interpreter's chaos infect the Rust engine's order.
