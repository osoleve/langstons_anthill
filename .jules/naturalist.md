## 2025-12-24 - The Frozen Core
**Creature:** The Ceryneian Hind
**Discovery:** This ecosystem is bifurcated. The soft outer shell (Python) is fluid and mutable, but the hard inner core (Rust) is frozen by law ("The First Amendment"). There are no `TODO`s in the code, only in the documentation. The future is written in `wishlist.json` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`, not in code comments. It is a place of rigorous separation.
