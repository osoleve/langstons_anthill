## 2025-12-24 - The Frozen Core
**Creature:** The Ceryneian Hind
**Discovery:** This ecosystem is bifurcated. The soft outer shell (Python) is fluid and mutable, but the hard inner core (Rust) is frozen by law ("The First Amendment"). There are no `TODO`s in the code, only in the documentation. The future is written in `wishlist.json` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`, not in code comments. It is a place of rigorous separation.

## 2025-12-25 - The Shadow of Time
**Creature:** The Moth 🦋
**Discovery:** This ecosystem maintains two physics engines. One for the "active" observer (`tick`), and one for the "unobserved" passage of time (`process_offline_progress`). This duality suggests a world that only fully exists when watched. The unobserved world is a lower-resolution simulation, a rough approximation of reality where nuances (like specific death events or complex system side effects) are smoothed over in favor of raw resource mathematics.
