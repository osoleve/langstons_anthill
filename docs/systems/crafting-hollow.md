# Crafting Hollow

*"A quiet alcove where ore becomes beauty. Here, ants cease to be tools."*

Where precious metals become adornment.

| Copper Ring | 5 ore | Adorns an ant, makes them Ornamental |

## Adornment

When an ant is adorned:

1. Their role changes to "ornamental"
2. They gain an `ornament` field
3. They generate influence passively (0.001/tick)
4. Their previous role is preserved

## Notes

The Crafting Hollow was built in response to a question: "What are they working toward?"

The answer: beauty. Purpose. Identity.

An adorned ant is no longer anonymous. They are seen.
