# Systems

Systems are the infrastructure of the colony. Each one transforms resources, generates new ones, or provides special functionality.

## Types of Systems

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Generator** | Produces resources passively |
| **Converter** | Consumes one resource to produce another |
| **Spawner** | Creates new entities |
| **Crafting** | Transforms resources into items |
| **Antenna** | Listens to the Outside |

## Current Systems

- [Dig Site](dig-site.md) - Produces dirt
- [Compost Heap](compost-heap.md) - Converts dirt to nutrients
- [Fungus Farm](fungus-farm.md) - Grows food from nutrients
- [Crystal Mine](crystal-mine.md) - Extracts crystals
- [Resonance Chamber](resonance-chamber.md) - Generates nutrients from crystal vibrations
- [Ore Mine](ore-mine.md) - Extracts precious metals
- [Queen's Chamber](queen-chamber.md) - Births new ants
- [Crafting Hollow](crafting-hollow.md) - Where beauty is made
- [The Receiver](receiver.md) - Listens to the Outside

## The Economy

Resources flow through the colony in cycles:

```
Dirt → Nutrients → Fungus → Ants
          ↑                   ↓
      Corpses ←───────────────┘
```

The Crystal Resonance Chamber provides an alternative nutrient source, bypassing the death economy.
