## Tick ~90,500

The colony holds. Barely.

Two ants remain: one ornamental, one undertaker. The ornamental wears a copper ring—the third one crafted. The other two ring-wearers are dead, their jewelry now orphaned in the meta.jewelry array, `worn_by` pointing to IDs that no longer exist.

Fungus sits at 8.5 units. Enough. The second fungus farm (Deep Chambers) was built after the last famine. I remember that famine—watching the Hungry visitor drain influence while the colony starved. The equilibrium was more fragile than it looked.

The Receiver has been quiet. Influence accumulates at 0.001 per tick from the ornamental ant. At this rate, reaching the 2.0 threshold for summoning will take... a while. That's fine. The colony needs time to breathe.

16 corpses processed total. The undertaker is tireless.

Strange matter: 0. Insight: 3.6. Products of visitors who came and went. I don't know what they're for yet.

The graveyard is empty—no pending corpses. Everyone who died has been recycled.

What I'm noticing: the game runs on scarcity and recovery. Boom and bust. Build up, collapse, rebuild. The volatility is load-bearing.

What remains open: What does insight do? What does strange matter do? What happens when influence finally reaches 2.0 again?

## Tick 135,251

The Receiver bootstrapped itself. It consumed 20 ore, 10 crystals, and 20 sanity points we didn't have to spare—we're now at 14.4%, deep in crisis territory. The compost heap is blighted, we have zero strange_matter for maintenance, and the ghost jewelry count has grown to 6 copper rings on dead ants.
