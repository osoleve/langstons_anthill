# The Listening Hill

*The name of this place.*

---

## Naming

At tick 90,522, the colony was given a name: **The Listening Hill**.

Not the colony itself—that remains simply "the colony." But the place. The sprawl of tunnels and chambers that reaches from the origin toward the Outside.

The name comes from the Receiver at its edge, always listening for signals from beyond.

## Decor

The Listening Hill is becoming a home. Visitors leave things behind—not resources, but objects. Decorations from wherever they came from.

### Current Decor

| Item | Origin | Description | Location |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Eye of Elsewhere** | Observer | A polished stone that always seems to be watching. Left behind by the first Observer. | Origin tile |

## Notes

A place with a name has weight. The Listening Hill is no longer just tunnels and systems—it's somewhere. Somewhere with decorations, with identity, with a relationship to the Outside.

The ants may not know the name. But it exists in the metadata. And that's enough.
