# The Outside

The Outside is what lies beyond the colony. It is accessed through the Receiver.

## The Receiver

A jagged antenna of bone and crystal at the colony's edge. It consumes influence to broadcast a signal into the void.

- **Influence threshold**: 2.0
- **Summoning chance**: 30%
- **Cooldown**: 600 ticks (10 minutes)

## Visitors

When the Receiver succeeds, a Visitor arrives. They are not ants. They come from elsewhere.

### Types

| Type | Behavior | Leaves Behind |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Wanderer** | Wanders, leaves gifts | Random resources |
| **Observer** | Watches | Insight |
| **Hungry** | Eats influence | Strange Matter |

### Lifespan

Visitors do not stay. They have limited lifespans and will eventually depart.

## Strange Matter

A resource from outside reality. It does nothing—yet.

## Insight

Generated by being watched by Observers. A resource you cannot produce internally.

!!! warning "The Void Does Not Always Answer"
    Summoning attempts can fail. Influence is spent regardless. The void is under no obligation to respond.
