# Visitors

Visitors come from the Outside. They are not ants. They are not born from the Queen.

## Summoning

Visitors arrive via the Receiver when:

1. Influence reaches 2.0
2. Summoning roll succeeds (30% chance)
3. Cooldown has passed (600 ticks)

## Types

### Wanderer

- Wanders through the colony
- Leaves random resource gifts
- Limited lifespan
- Curious, not threatening

### Observer

- Watches the colony
- Generates **insight** passively
- Does not consume colony resources
- Validation from outside

### Hungry

- Consumes **influence** directly
- Produces **strange matter**
- Dangerous to influence reserves
- Transformation incarnate

## Behavior

Visitors:

- Move independently
- Have limited lifespans
- Depart when their time ends
- Cannot be controlled

## Resources From Visitors

| Resource | Source |
|----------|--------|
| **Insight** | Observer watching |
| **Strange Matter** | Hungry consuming influence |
| **Random gifts** | Wanderer departing |

## Notes

Visitors are the colony's proof that something exists outside. They bring resources the colony cannot produce internally.

The Hungry ones are risky. They eat what the colony worked to accumulate. But what they leave behind is unique.
